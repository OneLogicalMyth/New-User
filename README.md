# New-User
A simple script that creates new user accounts in bulk from CSV, including adding them to required groups and creating the home drives.

This script will be built in to a PowerShell module at a later stage allowing for greater flexibility.

Fake users for testing are provided with thanks from http://www.fakenamegenerator.com
